I am soon going to start a job that will require me to become familiar with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). I've decided that it would behoove me to get serious about correcting the gaps in my knowledge of JavaScript caused by over-reliance on [libraries](http://jquery.com/) and [frameworks](http://backbonejs.org/).

After Googling/StackOverflowing, I've decided that my starting point will be [Douglas Crockford](http://javascript.crockford.com/)'s series of videos "[On JavaScript](http://www.yuiblog.com/crockford/)". After all, what better way to dig into a subject than by sitting back and watching movies?
